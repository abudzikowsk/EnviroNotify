## Key Features:

### Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W Integration
The powerful Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W single-board computer serves as the core of EnviroNotify, ensuring accurate and reliable data collection. Its compact size and enhanced capabilities make it a perfect fit for handling complex tasks associated with environmental monitoring.

### SHTC3 Sensor
The SHTC3 sensor, renowned for its accuracy and reliability, is employed to measure temperature and humidity with precision. This sensor ensures that the collected data reflects the true environmental conditions, providing valuable insights for users.

### Real-time Notifications
EnviroNotify goes beyond mere data collection. The project includes a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that notifies users instantly when there are significant changes in the environment being monitored. Whether it's a sudden temperature spike or a drop in humidity, users stay informed in real-time.

### Data Management with Hagfire
EnviroNotify incorporates the Hagfire library for efficient data management, including a job-based mechanism for deleting data older than 7 days. This ensures that the system maintains optimal performance and storage efficiency over time.

### User-friendly Interface
The PWA offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy interaction. Users can customize notification settings, view historical data trends, and receive insights into the overall environmental conditions.
